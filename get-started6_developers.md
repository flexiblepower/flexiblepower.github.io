That is great news! We need all the help we can get to bring this disruptive open source technology out there. We have dedicated another page that will guide you into setting up a PowerMatcher instance. The source code can be found on [github.com/flexiblepower](http://www.github.com/flexiblepower). Detailed [documentation for FPAI](https://github.com/flexiblepower/fpai-core/wiki) and [documentation for Powermatcher](http://fpai-ci.sensorlab.tno.nl/builds/powermatcher-documentation/master/html/)  is also available on github’s wiki as well as an [issue tracker](https://github.com/flexiblepower/powermatcher/issues).

Spread the word and help our community grow!
